# HeyCyan Smart Glasses (Android) - Data Transfer Notes

This file is the living reference for how CyanBridge transfers media from the glasses to the phone.
It replaces older/incorrect assumptions from the initial reverse-engineering phase.

## Repository layout

- `android/CyanBridge/` - Android app (CyanBridge) we modify and ship.
- `android/HeyCyanOfficialApp/` - Decompiled sources from the official app, used as a protocol reference.
- `android/CyanBridge/app/libs/glasses_sdk_*.aar` - Vendor SDK used by both apps.

## Working media transfer (BLE + Wi-Fi Direct HTTP)

The glasses expose an HTTP server during transfer mode. The phone uses BLE to trigger transfer mode + obtain the glasses' Wi-Fi IP, then downloads media over Wi-Fi Direct.

### Endpoints (confirmed)

- `http://<glasses-ip>/files/media.config` - plaintext file listing filenames (one per line).
- `http://<glasses-ip>/files/<filename>` - binary media payload.

### Trigger sequence (CyanBridge)

Code lives in `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/java/com/fersaiyan/cyanbridge/MainActivity.kt`.

1. Ensure BLE is connected.
2. Start Wi-Fi P2P discovery/connection.
3. Over BLE, ask the glasses to enter transfer mode and report their IP:
   - `LargeDataHandler.getInstance().glassesControl(byteArrayOf(0x02, 0x01, 0x04))`
4. Listen for notify frames:
   - `loadData[6] == 0x08`: glasses Wi-Fi IP present in bytes `[7..10]` as IPv4.
   - `loadData[6] == 0x09`: P2P/Wi-Fi error; `loadData[7] == 0xFF` (255) is common/noisy.
5. Bind the app process to the P2P network when connected (important on Samsung/multi-network devices).
6. Fetch `media.config`, parse filenames, then download each file.

### Critical gotcha: groupOwnerAddress is usually the phone

On many devices, `WifiP2pInfo.groupOwnerAddress` is `192.168.49.1` and refers to the phone (group owner), not the glasses.
Do not use it as the HTTP target.

Prefer:

- BLE-reported IP from notify `0x08`.
- Any other device-reported IP channel (e.g., `BleIpBridge` if present).

## File types and how we save them

The `media.config` list can include images, video, and audio.

### JPG/JPEG

- Downloaded over HTTP and inserted into `MediaStore.Images`.
- Saved under `DCIM/CyanBridge` via `RELATIVE_PATH` (Android 10+) so they always appear in Gallery.

### MP4

- Downloaded over HTTP and inserted into `MediaStore.Video`.
- Saved under `DCIM/CyanBridge`.
- Uses longer HTTP read timeouts.

### OPUS recordings

The glasses' `.opus` files are not guaranteed to be standard Ogg/Opus.
In practice, many are raw Opus packets (often fixed-size 40-byte blocks) without an Ogg container.

What we do:

- Download the `.opus` bytes.
- If it already starts with `OggS`, keep as-is.
- Otherwise try to wrap into an Ogg/Opus container using heuristics:
  - Length-prefixed packets (u16 LE/BE or u8).
  - Fixed packet size (includes 40 bytes; the official app uses `packetSize=40`).
- Write the resulting bytes into `MediaStore.Audio` with `MIME_TYPE=audio/ogg`.
- Save under `DCIM/CyanBridge` (same folder preference as images/videos).

This makes the recordings playable in common players (e.g., VLC) when wrapping succeeds.

## Android platform requirements / pitfalls

### Cleartext HTTP must be allowed

The transfer server is HTTP (not HTTPS), so Android may block it unless configured.

- `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml` permits cleartext so `http://192.168.49.x/...` works.

### Bind network for correct routing

On some devices (notably Samsung), sockets may route over the wrong default network unless the process is bound.
We locate the P2P network via `ConnectivityManager` and bind with `bindProcessToNetwork()`.

### Broadcast receiver compatibility

Do not call the API 33+ `registerReceiver(..., flags)` overload directly on pre-33 devices.
Use `ContextCompat.registerReceiver()`.

### Permissions

- Android 13+: `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` is required for Wi-Fi Direct discovery.
- Location permission is also commonly required for peer discovery on many builds.

## TuneBuds AI Photo Transfer Notes

TuneBuds uses its independent AB Mate Classic Bluetooth RFCOMM protocol, not the HeyCyan vendor AAR. Detailed image capture also uses a phone local-only hotspot and therefore needs the Wi-Fi transport permission flow.

Hardware testing on 2026-09-02 found that the Detailed permission rationale appeared but could not launch Android's permission sheet because `TuneBudsDashboardActionPolicy` rejected `RequestTransportPermission` and `DismissTransportPermissionDialog`. This was an action-gating bug, not a crash or ANR. Keep both actions in the TuneBuds allowlist while Detailed capture is exposed.

The same test produced an incomplete 4,084-byte Clearer image and then lost the next `0xE1` response. The cause matched the decompiled official AB Mate stack:

- `PacketParser` removes `55 AA ... A5 5A` AI envelopes from the shared RFCOMM stream.
- `ResponseHandler` logs top-level sequence gaps but still processes structurally valid command frames.
- CyanBridge must not discard a valid frame solely because its transport sequence skipped. Doing so can lose `0xE3` JPEG chunks and subsequent responses.
- Logical fragment indexes and command/type/total metadata should remain strict.

Relevant decompiled references are `TuneBudsOfficialApp/tunebuds-jadx-clean/sources/com/topstep/aibuds/earphone/PacketParser.java`, `com/bluetrum/devicemanager/ResponseHandler.java`, `ResponseMerger.java`, `models/AIPicPackage.java`, and `com/topstep/aibuds/earphone/AiPhotoSourceAbMate.java`. The full investigation is recorded in `android/TUNEBUDS_REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md`. Hardware verification of the patched BLE and Wi-Fi paths is still pending.

The first patched retest validated Clearer with a 192x144, 8,597-byte JPEG in 4,872 ms. Detailed exposed a second permission bug: Android 13+ successfully granted `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`, but `TuneBudsLocalHotspot` separately required ungranted fine location and stopped before calling `startLocalOnlyHotspot`. Keep its permission check aligned with `PermissionUtil.hasWifiP2pPermission()`: Nearby Wi-Fi on Android 13+, fine location only on older releases. Detailed endpoint/HTTP validation is still pending.

After correcting that gate, the phone hotspot started, but the glasses returned status `1` to `0xE7` on two attempts. The official `startPullFileInternal` maps `0xE7` statuses `1` and `3` to file-transfer `ERROR_BUSY`. Detailed had captured through `0xE1` but never closed the camera before requesting file-manager mode. Ensure recording-mode capture finishes with the `0xE2` busy-saving retry loop before sending hotspot credentials and `0xE7`; an arbitrary save delay alone does not release the camera subsystem.

The next run still returned `0xE7` busy after `0xE2` reached closed state. It also showed that failing immediately tears down `swlan0` within roughly one second, before the glasses can associate. Keep the hotspot alive and retry only `0xE7` statuses `1` and `3` during startup; do not weaken handling for unknown statuses or accept transfer readiness without the `0xE7` endpoint notification.

Hardware validation of that retry succeeded end to end. Three busy responses preceded hotspot association and endpoint `http://10.230.84.141:80/files/`; CyanBridge then downloaded `20250102155119977.JPG`, a valid 1,616x1,216, 350,372-byte JPEG. Total Detailed capture/transfer time was 11,672 ms. Trace: `/tmp/opencode/tunebuds-detailed-e7-busy-retry-retest-20260902.log`.

The same APK passed a Clearer regression with a valid 192x144, 10,221-byte JPEG in 4,349 ms while tolerating three transport-sequence warnings before completion. Trace: `/tmp/opencode/tunebuds-clearer-final-regression-20260902.log`.

## Error handling notes

- `loadData[6] == 0x09` with error 255 is common and not necessarily fatal.
- Resetting P2P while an HTTP transfer is active can drop the connection; CyanBridge suppresses aggressive resets during active transfer.
- Disconnect/retry logic is split between:
  - Wi-Fi P2P state machine (`WifiP2pManagerSingleton`).
  - Higher-level resolver in `MainActivity` that waits for a real glasses IP and a reachable `media.config`.

## Code references (CyanBridge)

- Main flow: `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/java/com/fersaiyan/cyanbridge/MainActivity.kt`
  - `startDataDownload()`: orchestrates BLE + P2P.
  - HTTP + parsing: downloads `media.config`, then downloads JPG/MP4/OPUS.
  - MediaStore saves: images/videos/audio saved to `DCIM/CyanBridge`.

- P2P controller: `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/java/com/fersaiyan/cyanbridge/ui/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManagerSingleton.kt`
  - Includes discovery/connect timeouts and uses WPS PBC.
  - `resetDeviceP2p()` sends `glassesControl([0x02,0x01,0x0F])`.

- Network policy: `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`

## How the official app differs (relevant parts)

Use this only as a protocol reference in `android/HeyCyanOfficialApp/`.

- Album import registers a notify listener with `cmdType=2`.
- It downloads `media.config` from `/files/media.config` and then files from `/files/<name>`.
- For recordings, it uses a native Opus pipeline (`OpusManager`, `hasHead=false`, `packetSize=40`) and often converts to PCM/WAV for playback.

## Logcat

Preferred tags:

- `DataDownload`
- `DeviceNotify`
- `WifiP2pManagerSingleton`
- `WifiP2pBroadcastReceiver`

Example:

```bash
adb logcat -s DataDownload DeviceNotify WifiP2pManagerSingleton WifiP2pBroadcastReceiver
```

## Development Environment

- **Java Requirements**: The project (specifically the Android Gradle Plugin 8.12.1) requires **Java 17+** to build.
- **JDK Location**: Use the JDK bundled with Android Studio, found at:
  - `/opt/android-studio/jbr` (Java 21)
- **Build Command**: Always set `JAVA_HOME` when running Gradle:
  ```bash
  JAVA_HOME=/opt/android-studio/jbr ./gradlew assembleDebug
  ```

## Compose Multiplatform (CMP)

The `:shared` module uses JetBrains Compose Multiplatform so both Android and iOS render from the same `@Composable` screens in `commonMain`.

### Key Facts

- **CMP Version**: 1.8.2 (Kotlin 2.3.10).
- **Material 3**: Uses `org.jetbrains.compose.material3` as Maven coordinate but `import androidx.compose.*` in Kotlin sources (same API surface as Jetpack Compose). All migrated screen files keep `import androidx.compose.*` — do NOT use `import org.jetbrains.compose.*`.
- **iOS Framework**: All iOS targets use a dynamic framework (`isStatic = false`). A static device framework gets embedded in `Frameworks/` by `embedAndSignAppleFrameworkForXcode` and the iPhone rejects the install.
- **Skiko**: CMP's rendering layer (Skia). Ships as `.dylib` for simulators, `.a` for device. The JetBrains Compose Maven repository hosts Skiko native binaries.
- **Test dependency**: `compose.uiTest` requires `@OptIn(org.jetbrains.compose.ExperimentalComposeLibrary::class)` on the `commonTest.dependencies` block. CMP UI tests (`runComposeUiTest`) need a rendering backend — they cannot run on the JVM "portability" target. Write pure state/logic tests for `commonTest` and use Android instrumentation tests for full Compose UI testing.

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build shared framework for iOS simulator (dynamic)
JAVA_HOME=/opt/android-studio/jbr ./gradlew -PenableAppleTargets=true :shared:linkDebugFrameworkIosSimulatorArm64

# Build shared framework for iOS device (dynamic)
JAVA_HOME=/opt/android-studio/jbr ./gradlew -PenableAppleTargets=true :shared:linkDebugFrameworkIosArm64

# Run shared portability tests
JAVA_HOME=/opt/android-studio/jbr ./gradlew :shared:portabilityTest

# Build Android app (uses shared CMP composables)
JAVA_HOME=/opt/android-studio/jbr ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

### iOS Host Architecture

The iOS host (`CyanBridgeKMPHost`) embeds a `ComposeUIViewController` via `UIViewControllerRepresentable`. The `MainViewController()` function is exported from the Kotlin/Native framework. Both platforms call the same shared composables from `shared/commonMain`.

### Kotlin Upgrade (Completed)

Kotlin 1.9.24 → 2.3.10 is complete. Changes made:
- AGP 8.12.1 unchanged.
- KAPT → KSP migration for Room (`room.schemaLocation` annotation processor arg removed; Room 2.7.0 with KSP).
- `-Xskip-metadata-version-check` kept for vendor AAR compatibility.
- Compose BOM 2024.04.01 → 2025.06.01.
- `kotlin.plugin.compose` replaces `composeOptions { kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion }`.
- Room 2.6.1 → 2.7.0; coroutines 1.7.3 → 1.10.1.
- K2 compiler fix: explicit `Array<Any>` needed in `MemoryChunkDao` queries.

## Logcat conventions

When investigating or reproducing behavior, prefer the following tags:

- `DataDownload` – all our high‑level logging for the BLE+WiFi data‑download flow in `MainActivity`.
- `DeviceNotify` – decoded glasses notify frames (battery, Wi‑Fi IP, P2P errors, etc.).
- `WifiP2pManagerSingleton` – P2P lifecycle logs (init, discovery, connect, timeouts).
- `WifiP2pBroadcastReceiver` – raw P2P broadcasts (peers, connection state).
- `LDHMethods` – reflection dump of all `LargeDataHandler` methods (used once to discover SDK capabilities).
- `BleIpBridge` – raw BLE payloads and any IPv4 addresses detected via regex.

Typical command used in this project:

```bash
adb logcat -d -s DataDownload DeviceNotify WifiP2pManagerSingleton WifiP2pBroadcastReceiver BleIpBridge LDHMethods
```

## How to compare official vs. sample app behavior

1. **Find relevant decompiled classes**
   - In `HeyCyanOfficialApp/`, search with `rg` or your IDE for:
     - `LargeDataHandler.getInstance().glassesControl(` – to see how official flows drive the glasses.
     - `writeIpToSoc`, `syncPictureThumbnails`, `syncHeartBeat`, etc.
     - UI entrypoints like `PictureFragment`, `AlbumDepository`, or OTA activities that handle imports.
   - Map the commands (payload arrays) and the order in which they’re called.

2. **Compare P2P controller**
   - Look for the vendor `WifiP2pManagerSingleton` in `HeyCyanOfficialApp` and ensure:
     - Intent actions (`WIFI_P2P_CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE_ACTION` vs. `WIFI_P2P_CONNECTION_CHANGED_ACTION`).
     - Retry logic (`discoveryTimeOut`, `connectTimeOut`) matches what we run in the sample.
   - Confirm where the vendor app actually calls `resetDeviceP2p()` and where it sends `[2,1,15]` over BLE.

3. **Compare notify handling**
   - In the decompiled app, locate the `GlassesDeviceNotifyListener` used for album/import flows.
   - See how they interpret `loadData[6] == 0x08` and `0x09`:
     - When do they treat errors as fatal?
     - When do they just retry P2P and keep waiting for an IP?

4. **Compare HTTP behavior**
   - Search `\"media.config\"` or `\"/files/\"` in `HeyCyanOfficialApp`:
     - Identify the exact URLs, timeouts, and error handling for media and OTA downloads.
   - Match our `downloadMediaList`/`AlbumDownloader` behavior to those URLs and paths.

## Investigation hints / pitfalls

- **Do not over‑edit the P2P layer**:
  - Keep `WifiP2pManagerSingleton.kt` behavior as close as possible to the vendor version.
  - If you must experiment, prefer *adding* logs or small hooks rather than changing connection/discovery logic.

- **Beware of IP sources**:
  - The glasses can communicate the IP in multiple ways:
    - As a dedicated 0x08 notify frame.
    - Embedded as text/bytes in BLE notifications that `BleIpBridge` can parse.
  - When starting HTTP, prefer device‑reported IPs (`0x08` or `BleIpBridge`) over hard‑coded fallbacks.

- **Error 255 (`0xFF`) is noisy, not always fatal**:
  - Both our sample and the official app regularly see `P2P/WiFi error 255` via `0x09`.
  - The vendor app handles this by resetting P2P and continuing; it still later receives the Wi‑Fi IP and downloads successfully.
  - Don’t treat this as “abort everything”; instead, log and rely on subsequent IP+P2P success signals.

- **Official app may piggy‑back on sample’s state**:
  - We’ve observed cases where:
    - The demo app appears to trigger download mode on the glasses.
    - The official HeyCyan app (running in the background) actually performs the HTTP transfer and shows the new media.
  - When testing our changes, ensure the official app is either:
    - Force‑stopped, if we want to confirm the sample can download on its own, or
    - Intentionally left running, if we’re trying to see cooperative behavior.

## OTA investigation notes

- OTP/OTA support is present in the SDK and official app:
  - Look for classes like `OTAActivity`, `startSocOtaServer`, or HTTP URLs containing firmware filenames.
  - `writeIpToSoc("http://<ip>:8080/<firmwareName>", ...)` is used to tell the glasses where to fetch OTA data.
- For future work on OTA logging/dumping:
  - Identify OTA configuration endpoints and firmware download URLs.
  - Log the full HTTP requests (host, path, headers) from the official app.
  - Observe how OTA binaries are chunked and written to the glasses via BLE or Wi‑Fi (glassesControl/BigData handlers).

### OTA HTTP APIs (current understanding)

- Base API host (from decompiled app + MITM):
  - `https://www.qlifesnap.com/glasses/`
- Relevant endpoints we have observed via MITM:
  - `POST /glasses/encryption/getKeys`
  - `GET  /glasses/device/scanConfig?app=HeyCyan`
  - `POST /glasses/app-update/appLastVersion`
  - `POST /glasses/app-update/last-ota`
  - `POST /glasses/app-update/last-ota/china`
- The OTA metadata call uses a `LastOtaRequest` JSON body:

  ```jsonc
  {
    "appId": 1,
    "country": "US",          // or "CN" for the China endpoint
    "dev": 2,
    "hardwareVersion": "WIFIAM01G1_V9.2",
    "mac": "C4:E3:BF:C3:A4:02",
    "os": 1,
    "romVersion": "WIFIAM01G1_1.00.23_2510111600"
  }
  ```

- The server response shape when **no update is available** (what we see today) is:

  ```json
  { "message": "No upgraded version", "retCode": 60001 }
  ```

  When an update exists, we expect a success `retCode` and a `downloadUrl` pointing at an `.swu` in the `qcwxfactory.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com` bucket. We have not yet observed such a response for the current glasses firmware.

### Example curl for `last-ota`

> NOTE: Tokens are short-lived account secrets; never commit real tokens.

```bash
curl -v \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
  -H 'token: <token>' \
  --data '{"appId":1,"country":"US","dev":2,"hardwareVersion":"WIFIAM01G1_V9.2","mac":"C4:E3:BF:C3:A4:02","os":1,"romVersion":"WIFIAM01G1_1.00.23_2510111600"}' \
  'https://www.qlifesnap.com/glasses/app-update/last-ota'
```

On the current firmware this returns:

```json
{"message":"No upgraded version","retCode":60001}
```

Changing `country` (`US` ↔ `CN`) or tweaking `romVersion` (e.g. pretending to be older) did **not** produce a `downloadUrl`, which strongly suggests the backend decides “latest vs. not” based on server‑side state, not the client‑supplied version string.

### OSS bucket and `.swu` downloads

- The official app’s debug code uses a pattern like:

  ```text
  https://qcwxfactory.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/bin/glasses/<wifiHwVersion>.swu
  ```

- We attempted:

  ```bash
  curl -L -o WIFIAM01G1_V9.2.swu \
    'https://qcwxfactory.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/bin/glasses/WIFIAM01G1_V9.2.swu'
  ```

  and received an XML `AccessDenied` error from OSS (“no right to access this object because of bucket acl”), which means these objects require a signed or otherwise authorized URL coming from the OTA API (`downloadUrl` in a successful `last-ota` response).

- Until the server actually advertises a Wi‑Fi OTA (i.e. `last-ota` returns a success `retCode` plus `downloadUrl`), we cannot legitimately pull a real `.swu` for this hardware from the vendor’s infrastructure.

### MITM workflow for capturing OTA traffic and tokens

- We successfully used **mitmproxy** plus a Magisk module to intercept HeyCyan’s HTTPS traffic:
  - Magisk module: `Always Trust User Certificates` (or any equivalent “trust user CAs as system CAs” module).
  - Install the mitmproxy CA as a **CA certificate**, not as a Wi‑Fi/identity cert:
    - Visit `http://mitm.it/` in the phone browser (with the proxy configured).
    - Download the Android CA and install it under security / trusted credentials.
  - Configure the phone’s Wi‑Fi proxy to point at the PC running mitmproxy:

    ```text
    Proxy host: <PC LAN IP>   # e.g. 192.168.1.50
    Proxy port: 8080
    ```

  - Turn **mobile data off** so HeyCyan can’t bypass via LTE.
  - Run mitmproxy on the PC:

    ```bash
    mitmproxy --listen-port 8080
    ```

  - In mitmproxy, filter for the vendor domain:

    ```text
    f
    ~d qlifesnap.com
    ```

  - Force‑stop HeyCyan, then reopen it and navigate to the About / OTA screen. You should see:
    - `POST /glasses/encryption/getKeys`
    - `GET /glasses/device/scanConfig?app=HeyCyan`
    - `POST /glasses/app-update/last-ota` (and sometimes `/last-ota/china`).

- The `token` header used by Retrofit is visible in these flows. This is the same value that `QcRetrofitClient` injects from `UserConfig.userToken`. Because user data in `/data/data/com.glasssutdio.wear` is stored in encrypted MMKV, MITM is currently the most practical way to retrieve a working token.

#### Pitfalls we hit with MITM

- **Wrong certificate type**:
  - Installing the mitmproxy cert as a *Wi‑Fi* credential causes TLS handshake failures and “no Internet” errors. It must be installed as a CA certificate and trusted system‑wide (with the Magisk module).
- **Mixed app behavior**:
  - Some apps (YouTube, Reddit) still reject the MITM cert and show “no connection”. Chrome and HeyCyan do work once the CA is correctly installed.
- **OTA button not always doing a fresh network call**:
  - The “check for update” UI in HeyCyan can display “already latest” even with all radios off, which suggests it sometimes uses cached state rather than hitting `last-ota` on demand. For clean captures, force‑stop the app before opening the OTA screen.

### Local tooling for future `.swu` analysis

- There is a helper script at the Android repo root:
  - `parse_swu.py`
  - Usage:

    ```bash
    cd android
    python parse_swu.py <firmware>.swu
    ```

  - It:
    - Detects obvious container types (gzip/zip/tar/ELF/squashfs).
    - Warns if the file is actually an XML error (e.g. OSS `AccessDenied`).
    - Scans for chip‑related markers (e.g. `JL7018`, `ALLWINNER`, `V821`) to help distinguish JL7018F vs. Allwinner V821L2 payloads.

Once a real `.swu` is available (via a successful `last-ota` response with `downloadUrl`), future agents should:

1. Download it with curl.
2. Run `file` and `parse_swu.py` on it.
3. Use binwalk / custom scripts to carve out the JL7018F and Allwinner V821L2 images.

### Future firmware‑dump directions (high‑level)

If the cloud OTA API continues to return “No upgraded version” for a long time, there are still a few *local* angles that look promising. Treat the notes below as ideas to explore, not as fully baked procedures:

1. **Leverage “pull‑mode” OTA over Wi‑Fi**
   - The SDK path used by the official app includes calls like `writeIpToSoc("http://<ip>:8080/<firmwareName>", ...)` and helpers such as `startSocOtaServer(...)` in `OTAActivity`.
   - Conceptually, this lets the **phone tell the glasses where to fetch an OTA image over HTTP**, using the existing Wi‑Fi P2P link.
   - A future agent could:
     - Run a small HTTP server on the phone/PC (e.g. `python -m http.server 8080`).
     - Place a known test file (dummy `.swu`) in that directory.
     - Call `writeIpToSoc("http://<phone-ip>:8080/dummy.swu", ...)` from a thin wrapper in the demo app or from a test activity modeled after `OTAActivity`.
     - Observe the incoming HTTP requests from the glasses (range/offset patterns, headers, etc.) to better understand how the SoC expects OTA payloads to be structured.
   - This does **not** depend on the vendor OTA servers and should work even when the cloud reports “already up to date”.

2. **Explore LargeDataHandler / BigData op‑codes for diagnostic dumps**
   - The same SDK namespace (`LargeDataHandler`, `BigData*`, etc.) already streams large media files and OTA state over BLE.
   - Decompiled code shows that there are additional op‑codes beyond the ones used in the sample app (some appear to relate to logs or diagnostics).
   - Future work:
     - Use reflection or static analysis on `glasses_sdk_*.aar` and the decompiled HeyCyan app to catalog `LargeDataHandler` methods and their op‑codes.
     - Compare those to how the official app handles crash logs or internal diagnostics (often gated behind “engineer” / debug UI).
     - If safe, add a narrow Kotlin wrapper in the sample app that invokes *documented* diagnostic/dump methods and writes the resulting bytes to storage on the phone for analysis.
   - Keep changes minimal and well‑logged; avoid blindly poking unknown op‑codes on user hardware.

3. **Hardware‑level investigation (ISP / FEL / debug pads)**
   - The headset uses a JL7018F main controller and an Allwinner V821L2 co‑processor; both families are known (from other products) to expose low‑level USB/boot modes for firmware provisioning.
   - PCB‑level investigation (only for experienced hardware folks, with full awareness of warranty and legal implications):
     - Carefully identify any labelled test pads / boot jumpers on the board (e.g. pads near USB‑C that might correspond to “BOOT”, “FEL”, etc.).
     - With the battery disconnected and ESD precautions in place, verify via `lsusb` whether holding certain buttons or shorting documented pads at power‑on exposes a new USB device (indicating a ROM loader or download mode).
     - If such a mode exists, consult chip‑family documentation and community tooling for **read‑only** flash inspection first (before attempting any writes).
   - This is invasive work; it should be treated as a last resort and documented carefully if attempted. Do **not** assume that methods used on other JL/Allwinner boards are safe here without verification.

## General guidance for future Codex agents

- Treat the vendor SDK (`.aar`) and decompiled code as authoritative for protocol details; keep our glue code thin and well‑logged.
- When something works in the official app but not in the sample:
  - First compare **method sequences and payloads** (what SDK calls, in what order).
  - Then compare **state machines** (when they retry, when they reset, when they treat an error as fatal).
- Always capture and reason from **logcat** before changing code; use the tag set above and keep logs alongside any code changes you make for traceability.

## CyanBridge Vercel Relay (cyanbridge.vercel.app)

The CyanBridge app uses a Vercel-hosted Next.js server for:
- Subscription management (Asaas recurring credit card)
- AI model proxying (OpenRouter)
- User authentication and quota tracking

### Server URL

`https://cyanbridge.vercel.app` — hardcoded in `AiProviderPrefs.kt` as `DEFAULT_PUBLIC_RELAY_URL`.

### Endpoints the app calls

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/billing/catalog` | GET | Public Asaas/Paddle provider offers used for price disclosure |
| `/api/billing/checkout-sessions` | POST | Authenticated provider-specific checkout-session creation |
| `/web-subscribe` | GET | Opaque checkout-session page; requires `checkout_session` |

### Payment flow (Asaas or Paddle)

1. App lets the user choose Asaas or Paddle and verifies the account email.
2. App posts `{ plan, provider, return_url, change_plan }` to `/api/billing/checkout-sessions` with the account bearer token.
3. Server returns a short-lived opaque `/web-subscribe?checkout_session=...` URL. The browser never receives the bearer token.
4. The session page renders the Asaas BRL card form or redirects to the Paddle checkout experience for the chosen provider.
5. Provider confirmation and webhooks update the RelayUser subscription state.
6. The server returns through the verified app link with only the one-time opaque result.
7. App calls `POST /pro/verify` to fetch the authoritative entitlement.

### Cancel flow

1. App posts the stored account token to `/web-subscribe/cancel`.
2. Server cancels the selected Asaas or Paddle subscription at the next billing period.
3. Server updates the RelayUser status in Vercel KV.

### OpenRouter integration

- Default model: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`
- API key stored in Vercel env vars
- All chat/voice/image queries proxied through `/chat`, `/voice-query`, `/image-query`

### Server source

The server is maintained in a separate repository at:

`/home/fertroll10/Documents/CyanBridgeLabs/Cyanbridge_website`

Do not add Flask, Termux, or staged Vercel wrappers under `android/CyanBridge`.

## Agent guardrails / lessons learned

### Untracked UI files can break Android builds

If a previous task left local Compose / Material 3 UI files in the working tree, Gradle may still pick them up even if they are **not committed to the current branch**.

Typical symptoms:

- `kaptDebugKotlin` fails
- `NonExistentClass cannot be converted to Annotation`
- failing stubs under:
  - `app/build/tmp/kapt3/stubs/debug/.../VersionUpdateDialogKt.java`
  - `app/build/tmp/kapt3/stubs/debug/.../FeatureOnboardingScreenKt.java`
  - `app/build/tmp/kapt3/stubs/debug/.../PatchEditorScreenKt.java`
  - `app/build/tmp/kapt3/stubs/debug/.../PatchListScreenKt.java`
  - `app/build/tmp/kapt3/stubs/debug/.../PublishPluginScreenKt.java`
  - `app/build/tmp/kapt3/stubs/debug/.../SimulatedGlassesPreviewKt.java`

Before changing protocol code or blaming Compose migration branches, check for untracked local folders first.

### What to check first

```bash
git status --short
```

Look for untracked directories such as:

- `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/java/com/fersaiyan/cyanbridge/ui/components/`
- `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/java/com/fersaiyan/cyanbridge/ui/glasses/`
- `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/java/com/fersaiyan/cyanbridge/ui/onboarding/`
- `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/java/com/fersaiyan/cyanbridge/ui/plugins/`

If they are marked with `??` and are not part of the current branch, treat them as suspect.

### Current branch strategy for Material 3

Material 3 / Compose migration work is intentionally kept on separate branches:

- `compose_material3_migration`
- `memomind-adapter`

`main` should stay on the current production UI approach unless the migration is deliberately merged.

### Safe backup location

To avoid losing that progress, back up the local Compose UI files to this directory before cleaning the working tree:

```text
/home/fertroll10/Documents/ML/HeyCyanSmartGlassesSDK/backups/compose_material3_port/
```

That directory preserves the local UI work that was removed from the active `main` working tree.

### Recovery workflow

When the Material 3 migration becomes the active priority again:

1. Restore from the safe backup first, or check out the dedicated branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout compose_material3_migration
   ```
2. Resolve the Compose / KAPT dependency setup intentionally on the migration branch.
3. Do not re-introduce those files into `main` unless the full UI migration is being merged.

## Current Session (July 29 2026)

### Objective
- Complete billing checkout‑session API and provider‑choice dialog (core work done).
- Fix image‑sync breakage introduced by Eyevue commits; cherry‑pick working image‑question flow improvements from the reflog.

### Key Facts
- Billing commit `0044185` is pushed to `origin/compose-material3-kmp-v2`.
- Eyevue commits (`1093f20`, `fcf4e3f`) added parallel audio recording, `onReplySpoken`, `offerSpokenQuestion` — all of which fixed image sync. They also added Eyevue‑protocol, Gemini‑Live‑routing, and TTS‑streaming classes which broke the data‑transfer flow.
- Solving approach: branch from `fcf4e3f` (known‑working commit) and surgically strip Eyevue‑protocol, `GeminiLiveImageButtonRouter`, and `StreamingSpeechSessionManager` references. Keep the image‑question improvements untouched.
- **temp-image-fix branch**: all Eyevue/TTS‑streaming removals done. `:app:compileDebugKotlin` passes.

### Completed
- Billing checkout‑session API & provider‑choice dialog: pushed.
- `ImageQuestionPrompt.kt`: `questionCueForLanguage()` added.
- MainActivity.kt: removed all Eyevue imports, `GeminiLiveImageButtonRouter`, `StreamingSpeechSessionManager.attachTtsEngine`, `downloadEyevueMediaList()`, Eyevue `startDataDownload` / `sendExitTransferModeIfRequested` intercepts, `0x02` notification‑handler Eyevue intercept, `onToken`/`onTokenDelta` streaming‑TTS path. `onReplySpoken` kept (pure image‑question flow). Dashboard‑action no‑ops added for 4 Eyevue‑sourced actions.
- `DeviceClass.kt`: `EYEVUE` enum value removed (already staged).
- `GlassesManagerGating.kt`: `DeviceClass.EYEVUE` reference removed.
- `assetlinks.json` created at `android/Carelens/website/public/.well-known/assetlinks.json`. **Not deployed**.
- `PRO_*` properties defined in `app/build.gradle`. **Not verified** for signed builds.

### Next Move
1. Sideload APK (`./gradlew assembleDebug`) to Samsung `RQCX700KSDF` and test image sync.
2. If image sync works, fold changes back onto `compose-material3-kmp-v2` via `git rebase --onto` or cherry‑pick of the cleaned diff.
3. Then add Eyevue protocol back → locate the break.
4. Then add TTS streaming back.
5. Deploy `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` to cyanbridge.vercel.app.
6. Confirm PRO_* Gradle properties for signed release build.
